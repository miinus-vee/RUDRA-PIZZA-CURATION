## Intro
Everybody likes a pizza, don't you? Being a foodie myself I decided to work on something related to it.Pizza is a kind of food belonging to the Eastern Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, where they cooked a layer of dough on a hot stone and covered with different kinds of ingredients such as meat and vegetables, and then taken Italian soldiers transported the recipe to Italy with the addition of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.\

This Website is a fun activity for the user to curate their own pizza. So basically when this website is presented to the users, they have the feature to decorate their own pizza.
Its kind of a fun activity.

## Explanation
In the 'index.html' file, I have included divsions related to pizza slices and further I have added buttons related to the toppings that can be added on the pizza.
 Further, in the 'toppings.css' file, I have added features to make the pizza and the buttons for the toppings more appealing.

## In future, planning to execute the following features:

- Users can decide how many slices they wish for.
- Users can see the animation of the toppings being added that they opted for.


## Applications:
This feature can be collaborated with various food apps like Eatsure, Dominos, Zomato, etc to give a interactive element to their overall site.
