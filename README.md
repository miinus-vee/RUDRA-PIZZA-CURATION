   # RUDRA-PIZZA-CURATION

This Website is a fun activity for the user to curate their own pizza.
So basically when this website is presented to the users, they have the feature to decorate their own pizza.
Its kind of a fun activity.

## Explanation
In the 'index.html' file, I have included divsions related to pizza slices and further I have added buttons related to the toppings that can be added on the pizza.
 Further, in the 'toppings.css' file, I have added features to make the pizza and the buttons for the toppings more appealing.

## In future, planning to execute the following features:

- Users can decide how many slices they wish for.
- Users can add their own toppings for the pizza.


## Applications:
This feature can be collaborated with various food apps like Eatsure, Dominos, Zomato, etc to give a interactive element to their overall site.
